# PhoneBo.cx kernel builder

This is the tool used to build the PhoneBo.cx kernel.

It has SPECTRE (and all the rest of the similar issues) mitigations disabled, and DAHDI built in,
including the new UA32XX drivers, which are currently not available in the standard DAHDI tree.

It is normally used by the PhoneBo.cx Distro Builder to create the immutable PhoneBo.cx OS.
